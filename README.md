# 🧩 Object Studio

**Object Studio** is a set of two tools — **Object Generator** and **Frames Generator** — made for **Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky object modding**.

-   The **Object Generator** converts **frames into objects** that can be imported into **SkyTemple** or converted back into **.wan** format using **GFXCrunch** for in-game use.
-   The **Frames Generator** recreates **frames from existing object**, allowing them to be viewed and edited in external tools such as **Aseprite**.

## Why Use This?

**SkyTemple** is an amazing tool, but when it comes to objects, it has a few big limits:

-   You can only import **one-frame, one-layer** objects — meaning **no animations**.
-   Objects are limited to **16 colors**, even though the game actually supports **up to 192 colors** (12 palette groups).
-   It doesn’t **reuse chunks** — it stores duplicate chunks instead of referencing repeating ones, which wastes memory.

The **Object Generator** removes all of these limits, letting you create **animated, multi-layered, multi-palette objects** that are memory-efficient and fully compatible with the game.

## 🚀 Installation
